Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)

Ask the user for a number
Ask the user for another number
Ask the user for an operator
If the operator is + THEN SET Output=NUM1+NUM2
If the Operator is - THEN SET Output=NUM1-NUM2
If the Operator is * THEN SET Output=NUM1*NUM2
If the Operator is / THEN SET Output=NUM1/NUM2
If the Operator is % Then SET Output=Modulus Of (NUM1/NUM2)
Display Output Number.
